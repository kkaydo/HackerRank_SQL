/*
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all 
employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key 
was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help 
finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with 
any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly 
salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

--SOLUTION 1:
SELECT CEILING(AVG(CAST(Salary AS DECIMAL)) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(Salary,0,'') AS DECIMAL))) AS output FROM EMPLOYEES;

--SOLUTION 2: (WITH)
WITH cte1 AS(
SELECT 
    CAST(salary AS DECIMAL) AS sal,
    REPLACE(salary, 0, '') AS fsal
FROM employees)

SELECT
    CEILING(
    AVG(sal) -
    AVG(CAST(fsal AS DECIMAL))
        )
FROM cte1;
